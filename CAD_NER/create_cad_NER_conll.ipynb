Valladares, M.D.\\n\\nMedical Director\\n\\nJanuary 27, 2089\\n\\n\\n\\nMedical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue\\n\\n\\n\\nProcedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.\\n\\n\\n\\nChief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson\\'s inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.\\n\\n\\n\\nStress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:  Significant medical problems include:  \\n\\n1.  Hypertension\\n\\n2.  CAD, status post MI 2082, status post PTCA 2082\\n\\n3.  Asthma (no hospitalizations or intubations)\\n\\n4.  Arthritis\\n\\n5.  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (with clinical manifestations of arthralgia, TTP and a high urine titer)\\n\\n6.  Chronic low back pain, history of herniated discs\\n\\n7.  Depression\\n\\n\\n\\nPast Surgical History:  Prior surgery includes:\\n\\n1.  Status post cardiac catheterization and PTCA, 9/82  \\n\\n2.  Status post D&C secondary to prolonged menstrual bleeding\\n\\n3.  Status post tubal ligation\\n\\n4.  Status post T&A\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily History:  There is no family history of adverse reactions to general anesthesia.\\n\\nBrother: alive, CAD\\n\\nBrother: alive, kidney disease\\n\\n2 brothers: both alive, diabetes\\n\\nSister: deceased age 38, breast CA\\n\\n\\n\\nMedications:  \\n\\npaxil 20 mg q.d.\\n\\natenolol 25 mg q.d.\\n\\nprednisone 10 mg q.d.\\n\\nhydroxychloroquine q.d.\\n\\nnifedipine XR 60 mg q.d.\\n\\nisosorbide 10 mg t.i.d.\\n\\nasthma inhaler (patient unable to recall name)\\n\\naspirin\\n\\n\\n\\nAllergies:  NKA\\n\\ndenies food and environmental allergies\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial History:\\n\\n\\n\\nSmoking:  denies\\n\\nAlcohol use:  denies\\n\\nSubstance Abuse:  denies\\n\\nAllergen Exposure (blood products/pregnancy): none in last 3 months\\n\\nExercise:  going up and down stairs usually, shortness of breath, expanses released when she rests at the top of the stair and drinks water; able to do light housework\\n\\nOccupation:  Firefighter\\n\\nMarital Status:  divorced, four children\\n\\n\\n\\nReview of Systems:  \\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral:  negative\\t\\n\\nHEENT: currently, LRI symptoms have resolved and patient feels much better\\n\\nCardiovascular: see HPI\\n\\nRespiratory: patient reports a diagnosis of asthma however her primary care provider (Dr. Younker X1-1335) who has seen patient for two years does not recall patient having any diagnosis of asthma\\n\\nNeurological: 9/81 patient admitted to PVH with thrombocytopenia purpura.  Suffered a cerebral thrombus with infarction.  Symptoms at the time of admission were severe headache, facial numbness, and facial droop as well as mutism.  Patients underwent plasma phosphor uses and became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive requiring emergent intubation.  Was felt that patient\\'s symptoms or secondary to a transfusion reaction.

Patient originally scheduled for surgery on 12/31/88 however because of LRI surgery was postponed.  Patient much improved, lungs clear, no wheezing, no shortness of breath.  It has only been three-week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue.  Dr. Hoffman explained this to patient.  Dr. Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1/28/89.  Currently, patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia.  Does have chronic chest pain/tenderness which is reproducible by palpation.  Patient states that this is not her \"cardiac pain\".\\n\\n\\n\\nPlan:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tProposed Anesthetic: general\\n\\n\\tMonitors:  standard\\n\\n\\tPain Management:  oral\\n\\n\\tAutologous blood:  none\\n\\n\\tPremedication:  stress steroid dosing\\n\\n\\tUsual Medications:  paxil, atenolol, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, nifedipine, Naprosyn, isosorbide, asthma inhaler, aspirin\\n\\n\\tMedications to be held on day of surgery:  hydroxychloroquine, Naprosyn, aspirin\\n\\n\\tDiabetic medications:  not applicable\\n\\n\\tNSAIDS:  will stop as of 1/27/89\\n\\n\\tAspirin:  will stop as of 1/27/89\\n\\n\\tNPO: after midnight the evening before surgery\\n\\n\\n\\nAncillary Studies:  \\n\\nPending\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\nJenna Q.
